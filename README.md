## Usage

### Basic Generator

1. Use the color picker to select yarn colors
2. Add colors to your palette
3. Set the number of rows and columns for your grid
4. Choose how many colors per square (1-4)
5. Click "Generate Grid" to create your pattern
6. Click "Export" to download your pattern as an image

### Book-Inspired Generator

1. Upload a book cover image
2. Upload your yarn inventory Excel file (or download and fill the template)
3. Extract colors from the book cover
4. Adjust extracted colors if needed
5. Select a literary trope for your book
6. Set grid dimensions
7. Generate your pattern
8. View estimated yarn usage
9. Export your design

## Yarn Inventory Format

The Book-Inspired Generator expects an Excel file with the following columns:
- No: Identifier for the yarn (e.g., "1.1", "2.3")
- Yarn Colors: Name of the yarn color
- Color: Hex color code (e.g., "#ff6b6b")
- Skeins Quantity: Number of skeins available
- Skeins Type: Type of yarn (e.g., "light DK", "Medium worsted")
- Skeins Size: Size information (e.g., "1", "4")

Category headers can be included as rows with only the "Yarn Colors" column filled (e.g., "Blue Shades").

## Color Extraction and Matching

The Book-Inspired Generator uses algorithm to:
1. Extract dominant colors from book covers using canvas pixel manipulation
2. Calculate color distances to find the closest match in your yarn inventory
3. Prioritize matches based on perceptual similarity
